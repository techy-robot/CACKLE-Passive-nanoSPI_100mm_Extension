# nanoSPI 100mm Extension Cable
> [!TIP]
> This board is part of a larger modular control board ecosystem, [CACKLE](https://github.com/techy-robot/CACKLE)

This is a super compact SPI flex cable being 2.4mm wide and 100mm long. It is quite simple

This can be used as a template for other nanoSPI sensors, or cables.

Also, the connectors for these sensors with a 0.35mm pitch are SUPER finicky to actually solder by hand, reflow is 1000% recommended. You will burn the plastic onto a soldering iron in one swipe.
